Creating a multi-user to-do list with JSP, Servlets, and JDBC involves designing a robust web system enabling multiple logins. 
It includes a database schema for user data, JDBC connection for operations, and user authentication. 
JSP dynamically displays to-do lists, and Servlets manage user requests and interact with the database.
The system supports concurrent logins, ensuring secure access to personalized to-do lists. 
Security, error handling, and an enhanced UI using CSS and JavaScript contribute to a reliable app. 
Thorough testing and deployment on a web server complete the development lifecycle.
